# JS-Local Bible
A simple offline JavaScript Bible that doesn’t require an Internet connection and features built-in search.

## How To Use
Download to your device and open the “index.htm” file in your device’s Internet browser. To open it in Android, navigate to the following address where “storage/\[SDcard\]/” is the location of the “kjv” folder. You may likely have to use the internal storage of your device rather than an actual SD card. Here's what some variants could look like:

> file:///storage/sdcard0/nkjv/index.htm

> file:///storage/DB74-1EFD/nkjv/index.htm

> file:///storage/emulated/0/nkjv/index.htm

## Navigation/Browser History
Unless you click on the chapter link, no browser history will be recorded. So if you want to return to the page you were just reading using the browser’s “Back” button, make sure you have already clicked on the chapter link first. Otherwise, only the content on the same page changes.

## Future Development
This satisfies me needs, but I might do some more later.

## History
So, I wanted a decent Bible app for Android that both didn’t require an Internet connection and supported multiple tabs. Couldn’t find one. So I finally put this together and added search, because that’s just convenient when you’re trying to find a particular verse!

Because it’s based on JavaScript it’s platform independent so long as you have a JavaScript enabled browser. Just copy it to your device! HOWEVER, usually Android is stupid when it comes to opening an HTML file in the browser. Never could figure that out, so you just have to go straight to the address of the index file as described above.
